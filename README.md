# AI in Sustainability - Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Overview
This repository contains a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for AI applications in sustainability, developed by **Mike Niner Bravog**. The PoC demonstrates:

1. **Environmental Monitoring:** Using AI to detect deforestation based on vegetation indices.
2. **Energy Consumption Optimization:** Applying *Linear Regression* to predict future energy consumption.
3. **Sustainability Chatbot:** A simple chatbot that answers basic questions about AI and sustainability (expandable into a fully autonomous assistant).

## Installation
To run this PoC locally, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Running the Code
Execute the Python script to detect deforestation risks, predict energy consumption trends, and interact with the chatbot:

```bash
python ai_sustainability_poc.py
```

## Google Colab
The code is also available as a **Google Colab Notebook** for easy execution without local setup:
